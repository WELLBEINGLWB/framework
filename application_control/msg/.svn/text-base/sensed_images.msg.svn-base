# This mesage contains all the (already registered) images taken by the cameras that sit on the robot's body (not on the gripper). The expected input to # the fruit detection and localization node is this message.
# When using this message to pass input to the fruit detection and localization node please take care to make sure not to simply put data in the images, # but also follow the constraints described below.

# The following constraints must hold for the above images:
# 1. All the fields in the "sensor_msgs/Image" message need to be properly filled in (especially the "encoding" field).
# 2. the xyz values are in the coordinate frame of the ToF SwissRanger camera (the camera's lense is the origin, x points left, y points up, z points away from the camera)
# 3. The rgbToXyz matrix is the same width/height as the rgb image. It holds the row/col coodinates in the range_xyz matrix corresponding to that pixel
# 4. The data type for each image is:
# rgb - 3 channels of 1 unsigned byte (3 uchars) (8UC3 encoding)
# range_intensity - 1 channel of 1 float (1 float) (32FC1 encoding)
# range_xyz - 3 channels of 1 float (3 floats) (32FC3 encoding)
# range_confidence - 1 channel of 1 float (1 float) (32FC1 encoding)
# spectral_images - an array of 1 channel of 1 unsigned byte (1 uchar) (8UC1 encoding)
# spectral_classification - 1 channel of 1 unsigned byte (1 uchar) (8UC1 encoding)
# rgbToXyz - 2 channels of 1 unsigned byte (2 uchars) (8UC2 encoding)
